# BENEFACTOR TYPES

<RasterImg src="Benefactors" alt="Benefactors" />

<br />

Benefactors are wealthy because they can afford a Harem of girls (must maintain
a minimum of 5 Harems girls).  The quality of the Benefactor is determined on
a points system by the quality and quantity of the Benefactor's Harem.  The
more girls you have - the more points you get.  The better the girls - the
more points they're worth.

Benefactors are so wonderful that they receive free NFTs that have value or
tokens that can be used to tip live girl models in the VIP chat room.  We're
always looking for ways to take care of our Benefactors and they shall be amply
rewarded.  Your benefactor can be upgraded as the value of your Harem increases.
